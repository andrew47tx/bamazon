# bamazon


Bamazon is a node.js application that simulates a user storefront, where users can "purchase" items, and track store inventory.

Tools Used
Node, MySQL, JavaSript, jQuery, and Inquirer

How it works
User command line prompts are written using Inquirer, while MySQL queries update store inventory quantities when an item is bought. This application provided practice in writing MySQL queries, and creating a Node command line application.

Running Locally
Required: Node.js

Fork or download and then from project directory:

npm install
npm start
